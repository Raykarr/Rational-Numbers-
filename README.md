# Rational-Numbers-
* This code defines a class RationalNumber to represent rational numbers and includes methods to perform arithmetic operations and comparisons between two rational numbers. 
* It also includes a main method that takes command-line arguments to create two RationalNumber objects and perform various operations on them.

* The RationalNumber class contains a constructor that takes two arguments, the numerator and the denominator of the rational number, and it simplifies the fraction by dividing the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor. 
* The class also includes methods to add, subtract, multiply, and divide two rational numbers, and to compute their absolute value, check for equality, and convert them to a floating-point value.

* The main method takes four command-line arguments to create two RationalNumber objects and a fifth argument to specify which operation to perform. 
* It then uses a series of conditional statements to perform the specified operation and print the result. 
* If the operation is divide and the denominator of the second rational number is zero, it throws an ArithmeticException with an error message.
